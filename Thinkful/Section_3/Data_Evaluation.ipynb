A way to get a better sample would be to either survey other aspects of Armenina society e.g. (doctors, plumbers, teachers, artists, etc...). The other way to get a better sample would be by surveying pub-age students from different cultures (American, English, Japanese, etc...). Sample sizes would therefore be more indicative of why 'Armenians' go to the pub."
